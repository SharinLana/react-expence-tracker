# Expence Tracker

> This is a simple expense tracker app.
The user enters information about purchases, and the application automatically processes the data and displays a graph of the intensity of the user's spending by months and years.
`NOTE: This application does not store user data (the entered information will be lost after the app is restarted).`

## The goals of creating this application:
The main goals for me as a web developer were to improve my skills in working with:
- React components;
- React props;
- useState() hook

## To start the app on your machine:

1. Clone the project to your machine by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/SharinLana/react-expence-tracker.git
```

2. To install the project dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

3. When the installation is complete, run the following command to start the app:

```
npm start
```

## Languages, frameworks, libraries, tools and technologies:
+ React.js 
+ JavaScript
+ React styled components


## Functionality:

- displaying of elements on demand (e.g. the data entry form appears on the screen only after clicking the "Add New Expense" button);
- dynamic display of input data;
- user-friendly display of the purchase date;
- dynamic display of spending intensity filtered by years or months;
- ban on entering invalid information in the price field;
- ban on trying to enter empty form fields;
- error modal window that closes when you click on the button, and also when you click on any place of the screen;
